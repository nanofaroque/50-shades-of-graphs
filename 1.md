## Introduction
An articulation vertex of a connected graph is a vertex whose removal will disconnect the graph (Chartrand 1985). More generally, an articulation vertex is a vertex of a not-necessarily-connected graph whose removal increases the connected component count (Harary 1994, p. 26). Articulation vertices are also called cut-vertices or "cutpoints" (Harary 1994, p. 26).[1]

## Welcome to The 50 Shades Of Graphs

### Problems: 
1. Articulations point of a graph.
2. Bridges in a graph
3. Minimum Spanning Tree. (With a simple example)
4. Maximum Spanning Tree. (With a simple example)
5. DFS (With a simple example)
6. BFS (With a simple example)
7. Vertex Coloring
    - how many unique colors so that no two adjacent vertices get same color
    - check if a graph is bi-colorable/bipartite graph
    - Minimum color needs to color US map
8. Floyd–Warshall shortest path algorithm
9. Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
10. Travelling Salesman problem
11. check if a graph is a tree
12. Diameter of a tree

## Welcome to The 50 Shades Of Graphs

### Problems: 
1. Articulations point of a graph. [click here](./1.md)
2. Bridges in a graph
3. Minimum Spanning Tree. (With a simple example)
4. Maximum Spanning Tree. (With a simple example)
5. DFS (With a simple example)
6. BFS (With a simple example)
7. Vertex Coloring
    - how many unique colors so that no two adjacent vertices get same color
    - check if a graph is bi-colorable/bipartite graph
    - Minimum color needs to color US map
    - Grouping people to avoid enemies. 
8. Floydâ€“Warshall shortest path algorithm
9. Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
10. Travelling Salesman problem
11. check if a graph is a tree
12. Diameter of a tree
13. Minimum Vertex cover of a graph
14. Minimum Vertex cover of a tree
15. Quadtree
16. Bellman ford algorithm
17. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
18. Edge covering
19. Flood-Fill algorithm
20. Hamilton cycle
21. Euler circuit
22. Strongly Connected Components in a graph
23. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in a tree
    - in a binary tree
24. Dynamic programming in Tree
25. Topological sort
26. Min Cost Min flow problem (MCMF)
27. Stable marriage problem/ Maximum matching problem
28. Tree Isomorphism
29. Union find with path compression
30. Centroid of a tree
31. Shortest Path Faster Algorithm when number of edges (m) = O(n^2). n = number of vertices
32. Find arbitrage in a graph. 
33. Detecting Knots in a graph. Here is a reference for us: https://greenteapress.com/complexity/html/thinkcomplexity014.html
34. Minimum Number of press needed to turn off all the lights. It is represented by a matrix like [[0,0],[0,1]], answer is 3 in this case.
